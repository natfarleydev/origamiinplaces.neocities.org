      Simple pigeon (traditional). I got this orange only
      paper recently and I like it. It makes models <i>pop</i>.

      Unseen Servant on Tant. I improvised this model at the D&D table because I had an

      roughly the size of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_pence_(British_decimal_coin)">2p</a>.

      Pegasus from <a href="https://archive.org/details/modernorigami0000sako/">Modern origami</a>. A very 3D model, difficult to photograph! This book was published in 1969, it's interesting to see how origami diagramming was different (and not as standardised). Very readable and well explained. It's also clear the <i>care</i> that goes into a book like this, nowadays books are 'cheap' to produce, but back then it was all by hand (I think!).

      As a kid, I would make this flower <i>constantly</i> from the offcuts of making square paper from A4 paper. As an adult I've discovered you can buy fake dollars for origami and it's so cool to see this design using 'real' dollar bills!

      I like to make butterflies on unusual papers. This is on a subway serviette. Somehow the shape of the butterfly always comes through even if the paper is soft.

      Panda from the latest British Origami magazine. I feel like this one is best enjoyed in stolen glances. Looking at it as a surprise makes it feel more real. I also love the final folds that make it stand up straight but also give it more body.
